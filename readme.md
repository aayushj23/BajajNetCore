# C# Iterations
1. for..loop
	- Indexed based
2. foreach..loop
	- object / item based in collection
	- THis starts reading the collection till end-of-collection does not occur
	- No Indexex are needed and no condition is required to evaluate the loop
	- more powerful
3. while..loop
	- COndition BAse
4. do..while..loop
	- Condition based but executes at leas once

# COnditions
- if statement
- if..else
- if..else..if 
- if ... if ... if , nested if
- switch..case..default

# OOPs
- DEfault Access Specifier of the class is 'internal'
- Class can contain Multiple COnstrctors with different parameters
	- THis is known as 'COnstructor Overloading'
- The class must be instantiated then only, the memory will be allocated to it
	- SYntax
		- ClassNAme obj = new ClassNAme();
			- Initialize all Data Mamers of the class
			- All Methods will be allocated in 'Code-Segment'
- Methods
	- Reusable functions those are responsible to Abstract the class behavior
	- The may habe input Parameters and also can return data using Output Parameters 
	- The method that does not return anything is define as 'void'
